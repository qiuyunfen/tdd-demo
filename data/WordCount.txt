In LDA each document may be viewed as a mixture of various topics where each document is considered to have a set of topics that are assigned to it via LDA This is similar to probabilistic latent semantic analysis pLSA except that in LDA the topic distribution is assumed to have a Dirichlet prior In practice this results in more reasonable mixtures of topics in a document It has been noted however that the pLSA model is equivalent to the LDA model under a uniform Dirichlet prior distribution
